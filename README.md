# screenshot-to-code

This simple app converts a screenshot to code (HTML/Tailwind CSS, or React or Bootstrap or Vue). It uses GPT-4 Vision (or Claude 3) to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate similar-looking images. You can now also enter a URL to clone a live website.

üÜï Now, supporting Claude 3!

## üöÄ Try It Out!

üÜï [Try it here](https://screenshottocode.com) (bring your own OpenAI key - **your key must have access to GPT-4 Vision. See [FAQ](#%EF%B8%8F-faqs) section below for details**). Or see [Getting Started](#-getting-started) below for local install instructions.

## üåü Recent Updates

- Mar 5 - Added support for Claude Sonnet 3 (as capable as or better than GPT-4 Vision, and faster!)

## üõ† Getting Started

The app has a React/Vite frontend and a FastAPI backend. You will need an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4 Vision API.

Run the backend (I use Poetry for package management - `pip install poetry` if you don't have it):

```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
poetry install
poetry shell
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

Run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

If you prefer to run the backend on a different port, update VITE_WS_BACKEND_URL in `frontend/.env.local`

For debugging purposes, if you don't want to waste GPT4-Vision credits, you can run the backend in mock mode (which streams a pre-recorded response):

```bash
MOCK=true poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload --port 7001
```

## Configuration

- You can configure the OpenAI base URL if you need to use a proxy: Set OPENAI_BASE_URL in the `backend/.env` or directly in the UI in the settings dialog

## Using Claude 3

We recently added support for Claude 3 Sonnet. It performs well, on par or better than GPT-4 vision for many inputs, and it tends to be faster. 

1. Add an env var `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `backend/.env` with your API key from Anthropic
2. When using the front-end, select "Claude 3 Sonnet" from the model dropdown

## Docker

If you have Docker installed on your system, in the root directory, run:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key" > .env
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The app will be up and running at http://localhost:5173. Note that you can't develop the application with this setup as the file changes won't trigger a rebuild.
